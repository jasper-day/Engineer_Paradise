# Engineers in Paradise

This is the GitHub repo of shared ideas and projects for the *best* apartment of 2022-2023 in all of Edinburgh.

The site will be built and published through Github Pages using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/). Like many of the projects on here, this is more because Quarto is awesome than because it's strictly necessary.

To add ideas or projects, add a `.qmd` file in the appropriate folder. When adding more folders, make sure to make a [listing](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html) page in the folder above.

To update the site after making changes, first [install quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/), then run:

```
quarto render
```

in the command line before pushing your changes. Your pages can include LaTeX, code in Python, R, or Julia, images, and so on. Check out the Quarto docs for ideas.
