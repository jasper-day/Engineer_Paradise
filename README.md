# Engineers in Paradise

This is the GitHub repo of shared ideas and projects for the *best* apartment of 2022-2023 in all of Edinburgh.

The site will be built and published through Github Pages using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/). Like many of the projects on here, this is more because Quarto is awesome than because it's strictly necessary.

To add ideas or projects, add a `.qmd` file in the appropriate folder. When adding more folders, make sure to make a [listing](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html) page in the folder above.
